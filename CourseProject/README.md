# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Introduction
These are all the files required for the course project for the Coursera
course Getting and Cleaning Data:

The data being analyzed is data is movement data from smartphones.  The
data was generated by researchers Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita,
Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto and Xavier Parra from the 
martlab - Non-Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
DITEN - Università degli Studi di Genova, Genoa, Italy and
CETpD - Technical Research Centre for Dependency Care and Autonomous Living
Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Vilanova i la Geltrú, Spain.

The researchers gathered data from the accelerometer and gyroscope
of smartphones worn by 30 volunteers while performing six activities:
walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing,
and laying.  They divided the data into test and training datasets
for the purposes of their research.  For this project, this division
has been undone and the test and training datasets have been recombined
into one dataset.

Our project requires that only the measurements on the mean and 
standard deviation for each measurement be extracted from the dataset 
for further analysis.  At first thought, this would be a process of
simply selecting columns that contain "mean" or "std".  However,
there are columns that are not mean or standard deviation measurements,
but instead are further analysis applied to measurements by the researchers
that retain "mean" or "std" in the column name.  These columns--which contain
"meanFreq" or "angle"--should not be included in our data for analysis.
(See data/raw/features_info.txt for more information on these columns.)

Once the appropriate columns were extracted, the data is to be tidied.
The intitial issue that jumped out was that the column names are values,
not variables.  Each measurement provided by the researchers can
be categorized in a number of ways:

1.  It is either data from the time domain or has had a Fast Fourier Transform 
applied and is from the freqency domain.
2.  It is from the accelerometer and represents linear 
acceleration, or from the gyroscope and represents angular velocity, 
or has had further calculations done and represent linear jerk acceleration
, or angular jerk acceleration.
3.  Researchers took the original acceleration data and divided it into
components, so the measurement is either the gravitational component or the
body component of acceleration.
4.  Researchers also divided the acceleration into the various vector
components: x direction, y direction, z direction, and magnitude.  So
a measurement is represents of these components.
5.  Finally, the measurement is a mean value or a standard deviation
value.

For example, one column in the raw data set is tGravityAcc-mean()-X.  
The value in the column represents the mean linear 
acceleration in the x direction of the gravity component without
the application of a Fast Fourier Transform (so it is time data).
The analysis script melts the data and transforms each of the 5 components
of the raw column name into a value leading to the reshaping of:

<table>
<thead><tr><th>&#8230;</th><th>tGravityAcc-mean()-X</th><th>&#8230;</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>&#8230;</td><td>0.3459274</td><td>&#8230;</td></tr></tbody>
</table>

to:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&#8230; </th>
<th>descriptive.statistic</th>
<th>signal.domain</th>
<th>acceleration.component</th>
<th>acceleration.type</th>
<th>vector.characteristic</th>
<th>value</th>
<th>&#8230;</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<td>&#8230;</td>
<td>MEAN</td>
<td>TIME</td>
<td>GRAVITY</td>
<td>LINEAR</td>
<td>X</td>
<td>0.3459274</td>
<td>&#8230;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Once the data is tidied the analysis continues by grouping the data and
providing a mean of each value of the groups.

## R Scripts

The download_data.R script will download the dataset required for this 
project.  It will record metadata about the download in the
download_metadata.json file. It will unzip the data and delete 
unnecessary files (Inertial Signals data).  

The run_analysis.R script will clean the data, tidy it, and summarize it
by calculating the mean values on the data when it is
grouped by subject, activity, descriptive 
statistic, input type, acceleration component, acceleration type, and
vector characteristic.  This summary data is then written to 
summary.dat using the write.table() function, as required. The 
run_analysis.R script assumes that the data is in the UCI HAR Dataset/
directory.  If this is not the case, you can change line 5 to point
to the directory where the data resides.  You can also change line 6
to change where summary.dat is written.
