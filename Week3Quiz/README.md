Week 3 Quiz

These are the scripts I wrote to answer the questions for the Week 3 Quiz.
The scripts are in the R/ directory, but should be run from the 
Week3Quiz/ directory. When run, the scripts will create a data/ 
directory and download required data files, if they are no already 
downloaded. You can use the R/run_all.R script to run the scripts for 
all the questions and receive a summarized answer.
