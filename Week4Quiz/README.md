#Week 4 Quiz

These are the scripts I wrote to answer the questions for the Week 4 Quiz. The scripts are in the R/ directory, but should be run from the Week4Quiz/ directory. When run, the scripts will create a data/ directory and download required data files, if they are not already downloaded. You can use the R/runall.R script to run the scripts for all the questions and receive a summarized answer.
